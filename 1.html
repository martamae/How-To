            <h2 class="secondaryTitle">Dowloading and Including the Popcorn.js library</h2>
            <p>First things first, you'll need to download the Popcorn.js library. If you click
            <a href="http://popcornjs.org/download" target="_blank">here</a> you'll be taken to
            the page to download the library. There are multiple options, but don't be overwhelmed. All
            you will need to get started is the full stand-alone Popcorn.js library</p>
            <p>If you have any confusion take a look at this image. This is the file you want: <br>
            <img src="images/download.jpg" class="downloadImg"></p>

            <p>Now that you've located the file the next part is simple. Download the file and save it
            as popcorn.js. Create an html file and include the script. You now should have html code
            that looks something like this:<br>
            <img src="images/include.jpg">
            </p><br>

            <h2 class="secondaryTitle">Adding a video</h2>
            <p>Once you have the popcorn.js library set up, it's time to add some media. In this example,
            we'll demonstrate how to add a video element. </p>
            <p>Here is the code you will use:
            <img src="images/addVid.jpg"></p>
             <p>You start with the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag. This creates and instance of a video
             element.</p>
             <p>The <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element has many optional attributes. The only ones we are going to worry about
             are: controls, height, width, and src</p>
             <ul>
                <li>The controls attribute indicates whether or not the video controls (play, pause, etc.) 
                are displayed. If it is included, video controls will be displayed</li>
                <li>Height and width attributes are pretty self-explanatory. They specify let the
                user specify the height and width of the video player</li>
                <li>src is the source url of the video. Alternatively, a <code>&lt;source&gt;</code>
                element can be used. The <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element can contain several video
                sources.</li>
             </ul>
             <p>If you are interested in adding other attributes to your video, you can find a complete
             list <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video" target="_blank">
             here</a>.</p>

             <p>Furthermore, there are three different formats of video file supported by the 
             <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element: MP4, WebM, and Ogg. Different browsers support different
             types of files. Information on browser support can be found 
             <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_video.asp" target="_blank">here</a>. If the 
             <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element is not supported by a browser, the text between
             <code>&lt;video&gt; and &lt;/video&gt;</code> is displayed. Often, to ensure that the video
              will play across the majority of browsers, sources for the video in all three supported 
              formats are included.</p>

             <p class="note"><em>**Note:</em> The <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element is new to HTML5 </p><br>

            <p>If you are wondering what this code produces <a href="gettingStarted.html" target="_blank">
            here</a> is the output</p>

            <p>Additionally, instead of adding a video element an audio element can also be used. The process
            of adding an audio element is fairly similar.</p><br>

            <p>Congratulations! You have just taken the first step in learning how to use Popcorn.</p>
